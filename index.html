        <h3>Here is Janice's Impact on All of Us</h3>
        <ul id="tribute-info-list">
          <li>  She would always share her many wonderful pies including peach and apple. </li>
          <li>  Her skill at card games such as BS and Gin Rummy were incredible. She had the best poker face with a hint of a smile </li>
          <li>  She had so many strong thoughts on politics and democracy, her passion shown through when we talked over dinner </li>
          <li>  She had a thirst for travel that I envy, using her passion to travel the world with us and others.</li>
          <li>  She had the nicest hugs whenever we visited. You could tell that she really cared about everyone around her </li>
          <li>  Despite having the struggles that she did living through the Great Depression and having difficult relationships, she always came out stronger</li>
